# Before Install

Before starting the installation, familiarize yourself with the [terminology]({% link before-install/terminology.md %}) and make sure that your environment meets the [prerequisites]({% link before-install/prerequisites.md %}).

It is important that you understand the differences between __Setup workstation__ and __Edge server__, since you will be asked to perform some tasks on each one of them at certain points in time.
