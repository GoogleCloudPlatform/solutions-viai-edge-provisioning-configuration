## Connecting simple RTSP cameras

<br>

Simple RTSP cameras cannot be queried or discovered automatically.

If your IP camera does not support ONVIF, you will need to write down its RTSP addresses manually, including a username/password pair if authentication is enabled. Use the RTSP stream information in the next chapters.

Once you have the camera information ready, you can start to [Collect images for training]({% link preparing-model/collectimages.md %}) in the next section.
