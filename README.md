# Visual Inspection AI (VIAI) Edge Solution

VIAI Edge is a solution developed by Google Cloud's [Global Solutions Engineering team](https://cloud.google.com/solutions).

This solution extends Google Cloud's [Visual Inspection AI](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/visual-inspection-ai) service to run on an Edge server. This allows fast inference and facilitates the integration with on-premise processes.
